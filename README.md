# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning üé•ü§ñ

This project demonstrates how to use Deep Learning for **sentiment analysis** on movie reviews from the IMDb dataset. The model classifies reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content.

## Features
- **Dataset**: IMDb movie reviews (pre-tokenized and padded).
- **Model**: LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network.
- **Tools**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Google Colab.
- **Visualization**: Performance metrics and predictions.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Marioxda1/sentiment-analysis-deep-learning.git
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab: Google Colab Link.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

Results

Accuracy: ~85% on the test set.

Example predictions included in the notebook.
